Alpha Release Path:

    - Document both pieces of example code
    - Add an example POD test script
    - Add some reasonable internal tests                (3h)

    - Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Tutorial
    - Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Steps
    - Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Integration
    - Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Architecture
    - App::Pherkin
    - Make sure all the internal links work



    + Add dist stuff                                    (0.5h)
    + Name changes                                      (0.5h)
    + Add an example based on a Perl core module
    + Add a pretty-print pherkin
    + Add 'When' as a command
    + Skip tests with no matcher
    + Proper eval of steps
    + Build a Gherkin corpus
    + Make parser work on newlines not indentation      (1h)


Future:
	- Tags
	- Transforms
	- Localization
	- Quoting in tables is broken

	DUNNO:
	- Unicode support is probably ropey

    The parser is over-complicated because of how it started life - simplify
