Alpha Release Path:
    - Build a Gherkin corpus
    - Make parser work on newlines not indentation
    - Document Calculator example code
    - Name changes
    - Add a viable test script
    - Add dist stuff

    - Document
        - Document Test::Pherkin as an introduction
        - Add a Tutorial around the core
        - Document Writing Test Steps
        - Document all the sub modules

    + Add an example based on a Perl core module
    + Add a pretty-print pherkin
    + Add 'When' as a command
    + Skip tests with no matcher
    + Proper eval of steps



Future:
	- Tags
	- Transforms
	- Localization
	- Quoting in tables is broken

	DUNNO:
	- Funny indenting? https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then
	- Unicode support is probably ropey

	Nice to have:
	*- Coloured output harness
	*- TAP harness
	*- pherkin
	!*- Sample prove test
	*- Fully feature calculator example
