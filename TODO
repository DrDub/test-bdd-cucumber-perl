Important
    + Get the Data.pm harness working properly
    + Stop the parser being monolithic
    + Colour output doesn't show step data
    + Get core features passing

    - Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Integration
    - Get the tests to suck a lot less

Future:
	- Tags
	- Transforms
	- Localization
	- Quoting in tables is broken
	- Placeholders in Pystrings
	- Unicode support is probably ropey
	- Pherkin isn't really fit for purpose yet
    - Pass against https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-features
    - The parser is over-complicated because of how it started life - simplify
    - Add support for explicit outlines
