If you are B<completely new to Cucumber>, you'd get a pretty overview from
reading our short and crunchy L<Tutorial|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Tutorial>.

If you B<already understand Cucumber>, and just want to get started> then you
should read the L<Step-writing quick-start
guide|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Steps>, the documentation for our
command-line tool L<App::Pherkin>, and L<How to integrate with
Test::Builder|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Integration>.

If you B<want to extend or integrated Test::BDD::Cucumber> then you'd probably
be more interested in our L<Architecture
overview|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Architecture>.
